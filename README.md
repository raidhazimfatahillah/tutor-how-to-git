🚀 Tutor Git: Git & GitHub Hands-On Lab
Welcome to your first Git exercise! In this lab, you will learn the fundamental workflow used by modern software engineers to contribute code: Forking, Cloning, Staging, Committing, Pushing, and opening a Pull Request (PR).

Follow the step-by-step instructions below to add your profile to our class roster.

📋 Prerequisites
Make sure you have Git installed on your computer.
Make sure you are signed into your GitHub account.
🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Fork this Repository
Look at the top-right corner of this GitHub page and click the Fork button.
Leave the default settings and click Create fork.
What happened? You now have your own copy of this repository on your personal GitHub account!

Step 2: Clone Your Fork to Your Computer
⚠️ IMPORTANT LOCATION CHECK: Do NOT clone directly into your default personal user folder! Create or navigate to your designated coursework folder first.

Option A: Using VS Code's Built-in Terminal (Recommended)
Create a folder on your computer for your CS work (e.g., Documents/Tugas/tutor-how-to-git).
Open VS Code, go to File > Open Folder..., and select your tutor-how-to-git folder.
Open the built-in terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~ on Windows, Cmd + ~ on Mac, or top menu Terminal > New Terminal).
Copy the HTTPS web URL from your forked repository page (click the green Code button).
In the VS Code terminal, run:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tutor-how-to-git.git
Open the newly cloned folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder or run cd tutor-how-to-git).
Option B: Using Standalone Terminal / Command Prompt
Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.
Navigate to your dedicated coursework folder first (do not run it immediately after opening cmd!):
cd Documents/Tugas/
Run the clone command:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tutor-how-to-git.git
Move into the project directory:
cd tutor-how-to-git
Step 3: Create Your Profile File
Open the project folder in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
Make a new student_<NPM-mu>/ folder, create a new file named <NPM-mu>.md (replace your-github-username with your actual GitHub username).
Inside that file, write a quick greeting, like this:
# Hello! I am [Your Name]
- **GitHub**: @your-github-username
- **Favorite Programming Language**: Python / C++ / JavaScript
Step 4: Add and Commit Your Changes
Go back to your terminal and check the status of your project:
git status
Add (Stage) your new file so Git starts tracking it:
git add .
Commit your file to save a snapshot in your local history:
git commit -m "feat: <jelaskan apa yg kamu kerjakan>"
Step 5: Push Your Changes to GitHub
Upload your local commit back to your copy of the repository on GitHub:

git push origin main
(Note: If Git asks for your credentials or email setup, run the setup commands shown on your terminal screen and try git push again).

Step 6: Verify Your Changes on GitHub
Open your web browser and navigate to your forked repository (github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tutor-how-to-git).
Refresh the page.
Navigate into your folder and verify that your new <NPM-mu>.md file is present!
🎉 Done! You have successfully cloned, modified, committed, pushed, and verified your changes!

📚 Common Git Terminology & Conventions
When writing commit messages, developers often use prefixes (called Conventional Commits) to explain what kind of change they made:

feat: (Feature) — Used when you add brand new code or a new feature to the project (e.g., feat: add profile page).
fix: — Used when you fix a bug or resolve an error in existing code (e.g., fix: correct typo in filename).
docs: — Used when you update documentation, comments, or README.md files (e.g., docs: update setup instructions).
style: — Used for formatting, whitespace, or visual changes that do not affect the functionality of the code.
refactor: — Used when rewriting code to make it cleaner without changing what it actually does.
chore: — Used for routine maintenance, like updating build scripts or dependencies.
